# Classifying and Balancing Chemical Reactions

Subject: Science

**Chemical Reaction**

- Any process in which one or more substances gets chemically changed into one or more different substances
- To represent a chemical reaction, we write it as a chemical equation
    - Example: H2 + CL2 → HCl
    - On left side: Reactants
    - On right side: Products
    - Multiple reactants / products seperated by (+) signs
    - Write the states (s, l, g, aq)

**Balanced Chemical Equations**

- When writing chemical equations we need to remember the law of conservation of mass
- When the coefficients are blank we need to balance the equation
    - Ensure that an equal number of each elements is present on both sides of the reaction
    - Same amount of atoms on left, and same amount of atoms on right

**Steps**

1. Identify elements for products & reactants → just write letter
    1. Both sides should be the same
2. Use subscripts to find # of elements
3. Identify unbalanced elements
    1. Multiply!
    2. If you multiply the first element, you also need to multiply the second element
4. Write in coefficient
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all elements are balanced

**Types of Reactions**

Formation Reactions

- Reactions of two or more elements to form an ionic or molecular compound
    - A + B → AB
- Example: 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O

Decomposition Reactions

- Are chemical reactions in which a compound breaks apart into its elements. Opposite of formation
    - AB → A + B
- Example: 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2

Single Replacement Reactions

- Reaction of an element with an ionic compound to produce a new element and a new ionic compound - “Swapping partners”
- If metal is switching, the first thing switches and if it is the non metal switching, the second element switches
- H2O can become H(OH) if there is hydroxide on one side and water on the other
- Two Situations
    - A + BC → B + AC (where A is a metal)
    - D + BC → C + BD (where D is a non-metal)
    - Where B is the metal & C is the non-metal

Double Replacement Reactions

- Two ionic compounds react together to form two new ionic compounds
- The cation or anion portions of two compounds switch
- Typically occur in solution (aq)
    - **AB** + CD → **A**D + C**B**
    - You must check to see whether the products of a double displacement reaction will be soluble - if not a precipitate will form

Hydrocarbon Combustion Reactions

- Hydrocarbons are substances that contain hydrogen and carbon
- Hydrocarbons can be easily identified because all have the same general formula:
    - CxHy
- Any reaction with oxygen that is fast and endothermic is considered a combustion reaction
- Anytime a hydrocarbon is combusted, we have a hydrocarbon combustion reaction
- Always start by balancing carbon, then hydrogen, then oxygen
- IF OXYGEN IS AN ODD NUMBER, THEN MULTIPLY EVERYTHING BY 2
- Before everything else
    - Divide # of H in hydrocarbon by 2
    - If odd, add coefficient of 2 in front of hydrocarbon
- The products of a hydrocarbon are always the same:
    - CxHy + O2(g) → H2O(g) + CO2(g)
