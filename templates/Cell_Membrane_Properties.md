**Structure**
- The membrane is not the same throughout
    - For the most part there are :: uniform dots (phospholipids)
<!--SR:!2024-11-13,3,250-->
    - Proteins and carbohydrates scattered across with various functions
    - Phospholipid bilayer

**Phospholipid Bilayer**
- Refers to the fact that the cell membrane is made up of two layers of phospholipid
- Has a phosphate :: head group (hydrophilic), love being attracted to water
<!--SR:!2024-11-12,2,246-->
- Has fatty :: acid tails (hydrophobic), hate water
<!--SR:!2024-11-13,3,250-->
- In a cell, outside of the cell is majority water, inside the cell is majority water, acid tails don’t like to interact, phospholipids will automatically form the structure with the tails away from the water

- Because the tails don’t like water, they come together in different ways

**Fluid Mosaic Model**
- Mosaic represents the fact that the :: membrane contains carbohydrates, proteins, cholesterol
<!--SR:!2024-11-13,3,250-->
- Fluid refers to the fact that the membrane is constantly moving
    - Things are :: allowed to move around throughout the membrane
<!--SR:!2024-11-12,1,206-->
    - Proteins are like boats in an ocean
    - Allows cell to adapt to whatever environment the cell is in
    - **Cholesterol** :: maintains proper membrane flexibility, and is essential for cell signalling and nerve conduction
<!--SR:!2024-11-12,1,206-->
        - Embeds itself in between the phospholipids
        - Phospholipids can slide by each other more easily
        - Increase the fluidity of the membrane
- Mosaic changes when the proteins move

**3 Functions of Cell Membranes**
1. Barrier: :: keeps bad things out, cell organelles it
<!--SR:!2024-11-12,2,246-->
2. Transportation: :: Because the membrane is the skin of the cell, things need to pass in and out, there are certain things that allow things to get in and out through [[Diffusion & Osmosis|diffusion and osmosis]] (in and out of membrane)
<!--SR:!2024-11-12,1,210-->
    1. Peripheral Protein: on the surface
    2. Integral Protein: inside the membrane
3. Communication: :: There are carbohydrate chains on the to membrane allow for the cell to communicate
<!--SR:!2024-11-13,2,230-->
    1. Reason for blood types
    2. Reason immune system can identify viruses

**Types of Transport**
1. Passive Transport: :: It is diffusion and osmosis, does not require energy, natural thing that happens. **Both directions**
<!--SR:!2024-11-12,2,246-->
2. Facilitated Diffusion: :: When there is a membrane protein, because the inside of the cell membrane is full of lipids (hydrophobic), anything that is hydrophilic cannot make it through the cell membrane without help, in order for this help to come, it needs to have proteins that make a hole in the cell membrane to get through. Otherwise, it is exactly the same, the particles will go in, ONLY through the protein, either channel protein (hole), or carrier protein (opens on one side, lets the thing come in, flips and opens the other side). **Both directions, no energy required**
<!--SR:!2024-11-13,3,250-->
3. Active Transport: :: Active transport has a protein that looks like a carrier protein, if there is a high concentration on the outside, but the cell is trying to get rid of something (waste), waste wants to go opposite than the concentration gradient, things will flow from low to high concentration. We need energy, in the form of **ATP** (the energy that all the cells use). **Opposite direction than passive and diffusion, TAKES ENERGY**

**Endocytosis & Exocytosis**
- Endo: In
- Exo: Out
- Endocytosis:
    - Form of active transport for molecules that are way to big
    - Form a vesicle, and fold in the membrane (fold around the thing)
    - The cell will close off a little bubble around it, to bring it in
- Exocytosis:
    - Exocytosis is the opposite, vesicle would bind to the surface, and leave the cell
- **Both require ATP**
