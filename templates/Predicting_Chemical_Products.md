# Predicting Chemical Products

**Rules**

- Compounds formed MUST be neutral (charges)
- DO NOT carry subscripts from reactants to products
- ALWAYS include the state for each compound (look at the solubility table for compound in solution)
- Balance the reaction last

**How to tell what state**

- Check if it an ionic compound (if it is then it is solid)
- Only use solubility table if one of the things is aqeuous (aq)

Formation / Synthesis

- For simple synthesis reactions, use your ionic and covalent bonding rules to create the new compound
    - Identify what reaction it is first (Formation = 1 element + 1 element)

Decomposition

- The opposite of formation reactions â†’ taking a compound and separating into its elements
- 1 reactant = decomposition
- Buddy up the diatomic/polyatomic elements

Single Replacement

- New compound is made by replacing the matching element in the compound. Metal with metal and non-metal with non-metal

Double Replacement

- The new compounds are made from displacing the metal (double swap)
- 2 compounds reacting = double!

Hydrocarbon Combustion

- The products will always be carbon dioxide (g) and water (g)
